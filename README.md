This research aims to investigate the impact of music tempo on attention during a reaction-time task that simulates aspects of driving. Previous studies suggest that music can both help and hinder attention, depending on factors like tempo and task difficulty. By collecting data on reaction times and self-reported distraction, we hope to better understand how music listening may influence safety-related behaviors.
